    "8. **Dynamic Dashboard**:\n",
    "   - Design an interactive dashboard to display the forecasts.\n",
    "   - Include design rationale expressing Tuft's principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare and process data using MapReduce/Spark environments.\n",
    "- Conduct a comparative analysis for two databases (SQL and NoSQL) using YCSB.\n",
    "- Provide rationale and justification for data processing, storage, and programming language choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design the architecture for processing big data using necessary technologies (HADOOP/SPARK, NoSQL/SQL databases, and programming).\n",
    "- Present the design in the form of a diagram and discussion in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: MapReduce-style processing in this context includes platforms such as Apache Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rationale, Evaluation, and Justification**:\n",
    "  - Justify the choices made in terms of EDA, data wrangling, machine learning models, and algorithms implemented.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "  - Evaluate and justify the hyperparameter tuning techniques used in the models.\n",
    "- **Analysis of Forecast**:\n",
    "  - Analyze the data and perform 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day forecasts of the close price for 5 companies using tweets and financial price data.\n",
    "- **Presentation of Results**:\n",
    "  - Use figures, captions, tables, and the dynamic dashboard to present the forecast results effectively.\n",
    "- **Tuft's Principles**:\n",

    "## Time Series Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves making a time series forecast of the CLOSE price for at least 5 companies using both the tweet data and financial price data. Forecasts are made for 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days into the future and displayed on a dynamic dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Requirements and Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Data Processing:** \n",
    "  - The project incorporates a distributed data processing environment like Spark for part of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Storage in SQL/NoSQL Databases:** \n",
    "  - Source datasets are stored in SQL/NoSQL databases prior to processing using MapReduce or Spark (HBase, HIVE, Spark SQL, Cassandra, MongoDB).\n",
    "  - Data is loaded into the NoSQL database using an appropriate tool (Hadoop or Spark).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post Map-Reduce Processing:** \n",
